# Post-and-Comments

- Using python and pandas (primarily) downloaded data from supplied URLs for posts and comments. 
- Merge them together to created a better structure where each blog has it's own comments in the same section 
- Implemented this code as a serverless AWS lambda function which does the work and upload the final JSON to an S3 bucket
- Created an AWS API endpoint to be used to trigger the lambda function.
